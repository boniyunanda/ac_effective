            <h2>What's Climate Change?</h2>
            <a class="sub-isi">Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels (like coal, oil and gas), which produces heat-trapping gases.</a>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Why Air conditioning was a big contributor to climate change?</h2>
            <a class="sub-isi">- Building operations, such as heating, cooling and lighting, account for 28% of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Now that summer 2021 is on pace to be one of the hottest on record, global demand for air conditioning is skyrocketing. That creates a vicious cycle because air conditioning itself is a major contributor to global warming. It uses a massive amount of electricity, and can leak potent greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. <a class="ref-isi sub-isi">(“Air conditioning is a major contributor to climate change, but these companies are trying to change that,” 2021)</a>.</a>
            <br>
            <a class="sub-isi">- Most air conditioners are fueled by electricity and use refrigerant that results in gaseous emissions that contribute to global warming and ozone layer depletion. In fact, some studies predict that by 2050, roughly 25 percent of global warming will be caused by air conditioning. Whether they’re window-mounted room units, central cooling systems or portable machines, air conditioners emit greenhouse gases, a class of chemicals that scientists believe depletes the Earth’s ozone layer <a class="ref-isi sub-isi">(Calm, 2002)</a>.</a>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Why We need to use our Air conditioning effectively?</h2>
            <a class="sub-isi">But you pay a price for lower temperature. When you set a lower temperature, the AC compressor works longer, which means more power consumption. On the other hand, if you increase the temperature to, say, 24 degrees, the compressor will work for much less time, leading to less power consumption.Once the desired temperature is reached, the compressor stops functioning, and only the AC fan works. The compressor restarts once the thermostat detects increase in temperature. A study in India shows that we are acclimatized to be comfortable at higher temperatures of up to 29 degrees, provided other thermal comfort parameters are met, said Mili Majumdar, managing director, Green Business Certification Institute (GBCI) and senior vice-president, US Green Building Council. The perception of comfort is a cumulative of temperature, humidity and air velocity, she added. </a>
            <br>
            <a class="sub-isi">“Each degree increase in the AC temperature can save about 3-5% electricity," said Majumdar. </a>
            <br>
            <a class="sub-isi">Increasing your AC temperature from 18 to 27 degrees can help you save around ₹ 6,240 in a year. Not only that, you also end up conserving 960kWh energy in a year (assuming your AC functions for eight months).<a class="ref-isi sub-isi">(Saran, 2018)</a>.</a>
            <br>
            <a class="sub-isi merah">From that statment if we use our AC effectively by increase AC temperature to 27 we can reduce our electricity 3-5% and after all it can help reduce climate change.</a>
